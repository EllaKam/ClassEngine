Please prepare a C# application with a simple UI that implements the rule engine we discussed.

Your task is to build an engine that parse class data and class rule data (upon service load), auto generate test classes according to the defined class and run the rules on them 

Attached are the class data, rules data and XML class examples.

 

Below is an example for the application you will build:

Present the class information as below
Present the rule information as below
Have a textbox where the user will be able to insert the number of tests to be generated by the program (auto generated classes)
Have a textbox where the user can load test classes from file location (folder containing XML files as per the SampleXMLClass attached)
